# EmailSenderPy

EmailSenderPy is a simple Python script that allows you to send secure emails using Gmail. This script utilizes the 'email.message', 'ssl', and 'smtplib' libraries to create and send email messages securely. It's a great tool for sending emails quickly and efficiently!

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Run the script using the command: `python email_sender.py`
4. Follow the prompts to provide your email information, including sender, receiver, subject, and content.
5. You'll be prompted to enter your Gmail app password for security. If you're not familiar with app passwords, refer to the note below.
6. The script will securely send the email and provide you with a success message.

## Note: Gmail App Password

For security reasons, it's recommended to use an 'App Password' for Gmail instead of your actual account password. Here's how to generate an app password:

1. Go to your Google Account settings: [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. In the "Security" section, find the "Signing in to Google" option and select "App passwords."
3. Follow the instructions to generate an app password specifically for this script.
